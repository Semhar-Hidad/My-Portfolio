   <h1>Hi, I'm a Technical Writer</h1>
   <div class="container">
        <div class="introduction">
                <p>My name is Semhar Hidad. I was born and raised in Texas, but now I hang my hat in Tennessee. My passion for technology and writing allow me to take complex technical jargon and create clear, concise, and most importantly helpful instructions that your users can understand. </p>

                <p>I have worked in Information Technology and Software Development for nine years in both commercial and military environments.  I served in the United States Marine Corps and I have a B.A in English from Middle Tennessee State University. My experience and education combined grant me the perfect insight into the kind of documentation that your users need and exactly how to create it for them.</p>
